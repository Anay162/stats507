# stats507
Stats 507 surveys the software tools that are currently popular among data scientists in academia and industry. The course begins with an accelerated introduction to programming in Python. Next, we focus on Pythonâ€™s scientific computing stack: numpy, scipy, pandas, and scikit-learn. We also cover using git and some general debugging and profiling techniques. The final part of the course is an introduction to deep learning using PyTorch.

The purpose of the repository is to have a public record of all assignments done in the course including the final project so that it can then be added to my portfolio after the completion of the course. An additonal benefit is getting familiar with using Github which is an essential skill.
